# **No Mainframe -- No Life**

Repository for sharing programs with my dear colleagues 


##  **Part one - import new products**

The goal is to insert new products received from company **AJCFRAME**, in order to suceed on this you need the following files:
- Main program [main_part1](./Programs/COBOL/iprod_part_principal.cb)
- Main JCL to compile, link-edit, bind and execute [jcl](./Programs/JCL/JCL_partie1.jcl)


## **Part two - import new sales**



## **Part three - export all and edit bills**


## **Part four - XML migration**

## **Part 5 - products && pieces analysis**




## **Authors**
